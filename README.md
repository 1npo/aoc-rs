# aoc-rs

My attempt at using Rust to solve Advent of Code puzzles.

## Usage

Run `cargo install aoc-rs-1npo` to download the crate. `aoc-rs` was already taken on crates.io, so I used `aoc-rs-1npo` instead.

Use the `solve` command to print the solution to the screen. For example, to get the solution for part 1 of day 1 in AoC 2024:

```
aoc-rs-1npo solve 2024 1 1
```

Use the `submit` command to submit the solution as an answer to adventofcode.com. For example, to submit the solution for part 2 of day 1 in AoC 2024:

```
aoc-rs-1npo submit 2024 1 2
```
